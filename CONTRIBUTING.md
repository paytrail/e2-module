1. Fork the repository to your account.
2. Push commits and make sure the pipeline is green.
3. Open a pull request describing your changes in detail.
4. Fix according to any feedback maintainers have given.

We recommend using [**Conventional Commits**][commits] standard in your commit messages to clearly describe what each change is supposed to do. 

**Example:**

feat(test): add fixture to unit tests

This makes writing new test cases even more robust.

See #123, #456
```

We use the [**StyleCI**][style] service for checking the code style. Unit and integration tests are run against supported PHP versions and they must pass before merge.
